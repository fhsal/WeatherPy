# WeatherPy

CWRU Data Analytics Module Six Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved learning about using API's by working with the OpenWeatherMap and google maps API.  The effort included generating 2000 lat/lng geolocation coordinates and using these to prompt a user to enter high/low temp conditions to search for hotels within the coordinate set, visualize those on a map. Four hotels were Then selected to build a trip itinerary and route map with pop-up information regarding hotel, city and weather information.      


### Purpose

The purpose of the Challenge was to demonstrate use of API's and visualizations to generate data used to interact with the API's, generating a clean dataset, interact with the user and then drive customized mapping visualizations based upon criteria input using OpenWeatherMap to collect data and google to create mapping and direction visualzations.   


### Summary

The 2000 lat/lng pairs randomly generated ultimately resulted in ~900 hotels being selected where name and location information could be found.   The visualizations are cool and the API's powerful.  

Items specified in the challenge instructions are summarized below:
