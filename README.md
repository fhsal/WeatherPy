CWRU Data Analytics Module Six Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved learning about using Tableau to work with a dataset containing CitiBike ride data from September 2018. The effort included converting data formats using Pandas and producing a variety of visualizations using Tableau around tables and measures such as peak hours of the day, gender, station lat/long and trip duration.     


### Purpose

The purpose of the Challenge was to demonstrate learning Tableau data import, customization (via calculated fileds) and visualizations.   

## Analysis 

The Challenge focused upon ride data from September, 2018.  The visualizations involed mapping, filtering, using color and size to emphasize trends in the data and separate different types of riders vividly.  Each of the visualizations used the same dataset with separate Tableau worksheets with maps, line charts and heat maps. 


### Summary

The analysis shows peak hour usage in the morning and evening hours.   There are higher volumes of rides for males than for females, although the trends are similar.  Unknown genders appear to have higher numbers of trips on Saturdays, while males and femailes have higher days of use during the week - although Wednesday is lighter for both groups.  

### Potential additional visualizations

There are several other potentially interesting visualizations;  Such as

(1) Top pick up locations by gender and/or day and/or time of day

(2) Average trip duration by gender and/or day and/or time of day
